# Evaluating the Impact of Latitude and Longitude on Air Quality Prediction: A Comparison Between Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressors

This research compares the effectiveness of Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor models in predicting Air Quality Index (AQI), focusing on the role of geographical factors like latitude and longitude as predictive features. The study aims to determine the most accurate model for AQI prediction by evaluating performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score. Results highlight the predictive value of adding geographical features, offering insights for improving AQI forecasting accuracy and model selection in environmental data analysis.
